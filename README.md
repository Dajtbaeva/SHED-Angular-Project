## Project overview

The main goal of this project is to create a platform for organization and management of schedules and events in any educational centers, small specialized schools or educational institutions. 

It was observed common problem that students could not find free rooms to study due to absence of study rooms in our university.

This project for managing university and educational centers' rooms would be a comprehensive system designed to help academic institutions manage their facilities effectively. 

The system would provide features such as room booking, scheduling, and availability tracking.

## Application of project

The software have a user-friendly interface that would allow users to search for available rooms based on current time, their location and availability. Users would be able to see a real-time display of available rooms and schedule meetings, lectures and other events with ease.

## Personal features

1. To authenticate clients to our web-page and make safe to some point, we used JWT authentication system.
2. When client register to our web-page the system automatically send message, which consists of username(what our system generate automatically based on name and surname) and random password to this username, to client’s e-mail.
3. To make our service safer, we every time convert users’ password to hash and save hash in our databases.
4. Also we include dynamical page state which defined depending on the type of user.
5. One of the main features in our service, is that every student can get all of available rooms at the time it was asked.
